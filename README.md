# coin-flip-serverside


Creating a coin-clip web application, where the coin flip happens server-side, and responds to the client-side with the proper information.

Summary: There is a coin on the screen, click on the COIN in order to begin flipping it. The coin will animate and flip multiple times, before landing on its correct position. 

Functionality -- 
  Click on coin --> server-side coin flip happens --> responds into the DOM with 'HEADS' or 'TAILS', and coin resets, ready to be flipped again.
